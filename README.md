# pogobot-helper

pogobot-helper is a Telegram Bot that helps Pok√©mon-Go Players to collaborate and coordinate in order to succesfully accomplish the RAID Battles.

It's written in Python and uses the [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) API.
It uses a local SQLite database for data persistence.
It uses [GNU Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) to launch itself with a Bash startup script.
